# ToDo List Project

In this project you are given a set of apps including a frontend, backend, and for the first time a database!

Your task as a cloud engineer is to get the applications all working happily together ðŸŽ‰

## Architecture

![todo app showing frontend connecting to backend and on to database](./media/images/todo-architecture.png "todo app showing frontend connecting to backend and on to database")

The architecture above shows how the applications interact

### Frontend

The frontend is a React application.

It makes API calls to a backend API to save todo items and to read them back from the database.

### Backend 

The backend is a Node ExpressJS API 

It accepts: 

* GET request to read todo items
* POST request to add new todo items

It saves and reads todo items in a Postgres Database

### Database

There is also a database directory that contains a Dockerfile for spinning up a Postgres database

## Instructions

The target goal for this project is to have the three applications deployed into your local Kubernetes cluster, deployed via Argo and bonus points for having them as Helm charts.

The steps from this point will provide you with a guide for breaking the task down as you iterate towards the final solution.

### Running locally

Don't worry about Kubernetes or deployment just yet.

Before trying to deploy things, you should get the applications running locally via Docker. This helps you to understand "what good looks like" before deploying things

To do this you will need to:

* Get the database container running
* Docker build the images
* Docker run the images
* Fix any issues such as port mappings or API end points 

As mentioned above, you will also need to build the Docker image for Postgres and get it running. 

We're not that mean to force you how to work out getting the database running so the list of commands below will help with that, but do explore the files and understand the commands before just copying them and applying. 

**ðŸ’¡ HINT:** Take note of the port that the command below exposes as well as the database username and password being used.

```
cd database

docker build -t postgres:1.0 .

docker run -p 5432:5432 -e "POSTGRES_USER=user" -e "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password"  -e "POSTGRES_DB=list_items"
```

### Container registry

Once you are happy with having the applications run locally, next its time to push those docker images to container registry.

You will need to:

* Set up a public container registry for the frontend
* Set up a public container registry for the backend
* Set up a public container registry for your database

Once the registries are in place you'll need to push your 3 docker images (frontend, backend and database ) to your registry.

**BONUS POINTS:** If you do this via a CircleCI pipeline. Challenge here is that this repo contains multiple applications so is considered to be a "mono-repo" which makes it harder to setup things in CircleCI so maybe come back to this one if you have time.

### Deploy the database to your local Kubernetes cluster





You will need to configure these apps on a local cluster using Helm and ArgoCD.

You should only have 1 container for the database to ensure that all of front end containers receive the same data and look the same to all of your customers.
