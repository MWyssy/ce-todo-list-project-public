# ToDo List Project

In this project you will be given a set of apps including a frontend, backend, and for the first time a database!

You will need to configure these apps on a local cluster using Helm and ArgoCD.

You should only have 1 container for the database to ensure that all of front end containers receive the same data and look the same to all of your customers.
